# Assignment 1

## Description
This project is created using **HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap**.  
It was given as an assignment to show my knowledge of web structure and responsive design.  

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – for page structure  
- **CSS3** – for extra styling  
- **Bootstrap 5** – for responsive layout, grid system, and prebuilt components  

## Special Tags / Syntax Used
- `<div class="container">`, `<div class="row">`, `<div class="col">` – Bootstrap grid system  
- `.btn`, `.navbar`, `.card` – Bootstrap components for buttons, navigation bar, and cards  
- `<form class="form-control">` – styled form fields  
- Responsive classes like `.col-md-6`, `.col-lg-4` – to make layout adjust on different screen sizes  

## How It Works
- Open `index.html` in any browser  
- Bootstrap CSS and JS are linked via CDN  
- The page layout and design automatically adjust for mobile, tablet, and desktop
